# TabView

A powerful tab manager extension for Google Chrome. Provides an overview of all currently open Chrome windows, allowing tabs to be searched, selected, closed and seamlessly moved within/between windows in just a few clicks.

Quickly opened by key command (Mac: `CMD`+`Shift`+`A`, Windows: `CTRL`+`Shift`+`A`), the user can quickly navigate the list with the `UP` and `DOWN` arrow keys, selecting one with `Enter`. Tabs can be moved within and between windows by clicking and dragging, and the search field will 'fuzzy-filter' the list based on user input.

To return to the search field at any time during arrow key navigation, simply hit the `TAB` key.

## Future Features Roadmap

- Closing windows
- Light / Dark mode
- Muting / unmuting of tabs from within the extension popup
- Tab multi-select
